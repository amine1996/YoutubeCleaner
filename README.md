# YoutubeCleaner

Simple greasemonkey script that removes video thumbnails from unwanted authors.

Partially working at the moment : Can be improved to handle events more properly

Two actions possible against garbage videos :
DELETE or REPLACE (need to be changed manually in the script)

Delete will simply remove the concerned elements.
Replace will replace its name by Garbage and thumbnail by a picture of some garbage.
